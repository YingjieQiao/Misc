## 5. Discussion
This visualization is concerned with the relationship between the GDP of a province/city and its number of top universities. This is an important question in China as it relates to the inbalance of development of economy and education in many places in China as well as the inequality of university admission problem.

It is shown that Beijing and Shanghai, the two biggest cities in China have both prosperous GDP and highly developed education, with far more top universities than any other places. Meanwhile there are province with a decent GDP but few top universities such as Hebei province and Guangdong province. It clearly shows the unbanlanced education development in China and it is one of factors that lead to the inequality in university adimission problem in China.
